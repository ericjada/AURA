## Collaboration and AI Integration

Throughout the development of this Discord bot project, I utilized the assistance of ChatGPT to brainstorm and refine key features like the AURA assistant and mini-games integration. With the help of ChatGPT's insights, I was able to enhance the bot's interaction logic and create a more user-friendly experience.
