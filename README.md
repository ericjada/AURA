## Features

- **Advanced Chat Integration**: The bot communicates using Ollama's models, enabling dynamic, context-aware conversations.
- **AURA Assistant**: Provides personalized interaction with a virtual assistant named AURA.
- **Birthday Tracking**: Automatically tracks and notifies users of upcoming birthdays.
- **Mini-Games**: Engage users with fun, interactive mini-games.
- **User & Server Information**: Provides server and user information through custom commands.
- **Command Logging**: Logs all command usages and bot interactions for auditing purposes.

## Collaboration and AI Integration

Throughout the development of this Discord bot project, I utilized the assistance of ChatGPT to brainstorm and refine key features like the AURA assistant and mini-games integration. With the help of ChatGPT's insights, I was able to enhance the bot's interaction logic and create a more user-friendly experience.
