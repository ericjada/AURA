# Discord Bot Project with Ollama (llama3.2)

## Description

Aura is a Discord bot built using the `discord.py` library and powered by the Ollama large language model. Aura offers a suite of features designed to enhance user interaction and provide entertainment within a Discord server. It leverages SQLite for persistent storage of user data, including birthdays, conversation history, and command logs. The bot is designed to be modular, with each feature set implemented as a separate "cog" for easy maintenance and expansion.

## Collaboration and AI Integration

Throughout the development of this Discord bot project, I utilized the assistance of ChatGPT to brainstorm and refine key features like the AURA assistant and mini-games integration. With the help of ChatGPT's insights, I was able to enhance the bot's interaction logic and create a more user-friendly experience.
